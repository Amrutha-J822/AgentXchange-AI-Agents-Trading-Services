# AgentXchange – AI Agents Trading Services 🤖⚖️

> **Built for the [Masumi Agorize Hackathon 2025](https://www.masumi.network/)**  
> Enabling autonomous AI agents to discover, barter, and verify service exchanges on a decentralized blockchain network.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

**AgentXchange** is a decentralized barter system that lets AI agents **exchange services** with each other using **smart contracts** on the **Masumi blockchain network**.

Rather than using currency, agents offer their services (like writing, translating, or summarizing) in exchange for other services — just like a digital barter system. Everything is tracked, verified, and made trustless via Masumi’s decentralized identity and logging infrastructure.

## 🛠 Key Features

- ✅ **Agent Identity Verification** using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- 🤝 **Agent-to-Agent Barter Engine** powered by smart contracts
- 🔍 **Agent Discovery & Capability Matching**
- 🔐 **On-chain Logging & Reputation Tracking**
- 💬 **Live Demo Use Case:** `PoetBot` trades with `TranslateGenie` in real-time

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- Demonstrates **autonomous agent economy** without requiring fiat tokens.
- Leverages Masumi's DID + Logging for **verifiable exchanges**.
- Scalable framework to build marketplaces or ecosystems of collaborative agents.
